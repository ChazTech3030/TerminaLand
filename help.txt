Welcome to TerminaLand, a game designed to help you learn and understand how to utilise commands in the terminal. The aim of the game is to defeat the Evil Wizard by any means necessary!

To begin to understand what capabilities you currently have, run the "commands" command in the prompt. From there, it is up to you to being your investigation into TerminaLand.

Be sure to investigate everything and anything that you come across. You may find that you need to revisit locations you have already visited once you have unlocked new commands.

Good Luck!
